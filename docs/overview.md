# DexVantage: models and methods

Every model DexVantage uses, written out with its equations, references and limits. Each phase adds its models here.

## Frames and units {#frames}

Units are SI. The world frame is the primary robot's base frame (REP-103: x forward, y left, z up). A camera's
optical frame is REP-103's `_optical_frame`: z along the optical axis, x right, y down. For a camera link whose x axis
is the optical axis, a point's optical coordinates are

    p_opt = B · p_body,   B = [[0, −1, 0], [0, 0, −1], [1, 0, 0]].

Rotations are unit quaternions q = (x, y, z, w) with w ≥ 0 (one of the two signs, so equal rotations compare equal).
The matrix is the standard one [Shoemake 1985]; the inverse uses Shepperd's method [Shepperd 1978], taking the
largest of the four diagonal combinations so half turns stay accurate. URDF's rpy is R = R_z(yaw) · R_y(pitch) ·
R_x(roll) (fixed axes x, y, z). MuJoCo writes (w, x, y, z); the conversion happens at the boundary. The angle between
two rotations is 2·atan2(|v|, |w|) of q₁⁻¹ q₂, which keeps full precision for small angles.

**Validation:** six checks against scipy's Rotation and MuJoCo's `mju_quat2Mat` (worst error 3 × 10⁻¹⁴).
**Known limits:** rpy is singular at pitch ±90° (the yaw takes the whole turn there).

## The project summary and the dense-voxel limit {#summary}

A dense axis-aligned grid over a box of edges (a, b, c) at voxel size s has N = ⌈a/s⌉·⌈b/s⌉·⌈c/s⌉ voxels. At 1 mm,
1.5 × 1.5 × 1.2 m needs 2.7 × 10⁹ voxels, so the coverage studies (Phase 2) use 5 mm by default and refine to 1–2 mm
only inside refinement regions. The summary reports N at the chosen size and at 1 mm, and marks a dense grid above
5 × 10⁷ voxels as not feasible (the limit is a documented default of this build, not a standard).

## Provenance {#provenance}

As Vantage: a block under `provenance` (schema `dexvantage.provenance/1`) with the version, a SHA-256 of the package
sources, library versions, the project's content hash and per-section hashes, the study and its settings, seeds,
the batch command with paths reduced to file names, and the SHA-256 of the result without its time stamps.
`--reproduce` re-runs a result and compares every number. No path, user or host name is ever written.

## Validation {#formats}

`dexvantage --validate DIR` or Help ▸ Validate the models. Each check compares one model quantity with an independent
reference and passes when the error is at most its stated tolerance. Phase 0: 8 checks (frames; the project file
against its JSON Schema through the jsonschema package; save and load identical).
